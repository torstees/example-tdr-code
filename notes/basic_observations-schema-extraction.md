# Issues
We'll need to get the object IDs that we are interested in. The one that was in the version Robert provided me resulted in 404. I either don't have permission or it no longer exists. 

# Notes
These will be "barebones" DD. Probably not any different from what we might get from parsing the data directly. In fact, we will probably need to actually grab the data for string columns and try to understand if they are enumerations. That should be doable. 

# Requirements
pip install data-repo-client
pip install requests

# TODO
To get the data itself in order to recognize enumerations, we'll need to either hit the big table or maybe we could grab it directly from TDR.
